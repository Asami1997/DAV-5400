    "# 1.Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "## Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "The gaming industry have been perennially pushing the boundaries of what is attainable. The video game market could very well be a $300 billion [1] industry by 2025 with contributions like cloud gaming, for instance Google’s stadia [2] as well as mobile games[3], In fact, both retro and modern video games command the sort of cultural influence that was once reserved for other areas in the entertainment industry such as movies and TV-shows but it's a new age, now video-games are more prevalent than ever and they are on the rise [4].To put it into perspective, Rockstar games' \"GTA V\" is the most profitable entertainment product in history over-shadowing any other medium by a staggering 6 billion dollar revenue[5].\n",
    "\n",
    "## Project Scope\n",
    "Death stranding [6] is an upcoming  action game designed, written, produced and directed by the legendary hideo kojima and is set to be released in November 8th 2019, there has been a lot of ruckus regarding that game in the media, however in a lot of scenarios the media pother doesn't imply success for instance will smith's movie Gemini-man is facing 75$ million dollar loss which was a huge disappointing and was an unexpected upset[7]. So in this project we make belief that we are on the analytics team at Sony interactive entertainment and we endeavor to think strategically about how we would market to the American audience or in this context gamers on the state level through text Sentiment-analysis, we are also curious to know what is the predicted revenue of death stranding."

    "# 2.Research Questions\n",
    "A lot of money has been spent on this game when you consider the names of the actors involved like Mads Mikkelsen, Troy baker and Norman Reedus[8] alone the expenses immediately sky-rocket, let alone the money paid in development and all the other areas in production, so it is imperative to for the game to be a success, \n",
    "\n",
    "### So the questions that we should take into account are\n",
    "- How do people feel about our product and what do they say?\n",
    "- Where should Sony market in the world? and where should Sony market less?\n",
    "- How could we influence the individuals, who are not very keen on the video game?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Is this project relevant to the real world and is this endeavor even applicable?\n",
    "The answer is absolutely!, Not only is this project reproducible but it will remain relevant for as long as the entertainment industry is around it is very transferable, so for instance you can take the same measures to understand how to efficiently use underutilized crops and that is has been implemented by CFF crops for the future [9], but within this scope we will optimize our sales by understanding the market perception of our product"

    "A) Then main source of data, will come from Twitter, more specifically the tweets related to the Sony video game death stranding we will throw API requests and the data collected will be stored in a database (the approach is explained in the next section), the type of data here is text, The words used for classification are going to be obtained mainly from the wordNet database.\n",
    "\n",
    "B) The secondary data source of this project  is a CSV file, This dataset contains a list of video games with sales greater than 100,000 copies. It was generated by a scrape of vgchartz.com, The script to scrape the data is available at [11] It is based on BeautifulSoup using Python.\n",

    "-We split the project into two parts, where you will find the bulk of the work in the second part.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Part I\n",
    "In this project we aim to understand the market more, so we start out by first using the vgsales data to understand how does Sony published games usually do from the sales perspective and will look at it from a global point of view, more specifically Among the 16,598 records contained in the video games sales dataset we will store the records related to Sony Interactive Entertainment exclusively. We plan to analyse the information regarding its sales and provide some summary statistics and graphics using Tableau, to understand the market a bit more.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Part II\n",
    "Then we will extract tweets about the game \"death stranding\" and perform requests to the social network Twitter using its API to collect tweets regarding death stranding. We plan to store the tweets and its location in a database. To be able to perform this we will create a Twitter developer account and use a Python library called Tweepy alongside with some other secondary libraries, then obtain the corresponding Keys and tokens to interact with the API to get the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The API has some limitations in the amount of requests every 15 minutes, so we will perform this operation incrementally as time passes by, as we plan to understand how people react to death stranding in the hopes of answering our research questions and the way we intend to do this is through classifying the tweets into positive tweets and negative tweets in relation to their geographical location as for the tweets that don't have a geographical location they will be considered separately that way we will have a comprehensive idea of the video game market's sentiment towards our product.\n",
    "\n",
    "but since the release date is on November 8, 2019 it is imperative to get more tweets around that time because we would like to know what type of improvements does Sony need to make inorder to make more money.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Algorithm Description\n",
    "1. Pre-process each text (i.e. remove HTML tags, noisy characters). \n",
    "2. Initialize the total text sentiment score: s ← 0.\n",
    "3. Tokenize text. For each token, check if it is present in a sentiment dictionary.\n",
    " - (a) If token is present in dictionary,\n",
    " - i. If token is positive, then s ← s + w.\n",
    " - ii. If token is negative, then s ← s − w.\n",
    "4. Look at total text sentiment score s,\n",
    " - (a) If s > threshold, then classify the text as positive.\n",
    " - (b) If s < threshold, then classify the text as negative.\n",
    "\n",
    "In dictionary-based techniques the idea is to first collect a small set of opinion words manually with\n",
    "known orientations, and then to grow this set by searching in the WordNet dictionary for their synonyms and antonyms which we will find using NLTK library. The newly found words are added to the seed list. The next iteration starts. The iterative process stops when no more new words are\n",
    "found[12].\n"
